**Faces 1.0 is a complete rewrite and is not compatible with any previous release.**

## Introduction

Faces is a framework that standardizes the implementation of using multiple avatar providers within web applications. Any developer can create a strategies for an avatar provider to be used in conjunction with Faces.

In order to use Faces in your applications, you will need to leverage one or more strategies. These strategies are generally released individually as RubyGems.

This library is heavily inspired by [OmniAuth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) in its implementation, as is this README. Big kudos to [Intridea](http://intridea.com) for creating such an awesome library.

##Â Usage

Each Faces strategy is Rack Middleware. For example, to use the built-in Default strategy I might do this:

    require 'sinatra'
    require 'faces'

    class MyApplication < Sinatra::Base
      use Rack::Session::Cookie
      use Faces::Strategies::Default, User, 'http://example.com/default_avatar.png'
    end

Faces is built for multi-provider avatar implementations however, and therefore you may wish to define multiple strategies. For this, the built-in `Faces::Builder` class gives you a simple way to specify multiple strategies. 

The following is an example you might put in a Rails initializer at `config/initializers/faces.rb`:

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use Faces::Builder do
      provider :default, User, 'http://example.com/default_avatar.png'
      provider :gravatar, User, 'email'
    end

You should look to the documentation for each provider you use for specific initialization requirements.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'faces'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install faces
